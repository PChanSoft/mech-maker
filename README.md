## Introduction
This is a simple application that will allow users to create new components to assemble their mech.
There will be text boxes that allows users to input an name and value for each part.
- Head
- Torso
- Arms
- Legs

Each will have some parameters to determine their attirbutes out of a total value.

##### For example:
> Name of Head part : Snow Bunny X
> Head Speed attribute: 5/10
> Name of Torso Part : Minotaur Steel
> Torso Defense attribute: 10/10
> ETC

There will be a total value the whole mech can have, equal to the sum of it's parts. As per the previous example, that would be 15 out of 30 total points that can be distributed.

## User Login
Included will be a login feature, so user's can store their mech creations into the database, which can be retrieved at any time by that user. We will have a simple login GUI to accomplish this.

## Styling
We will have simple styling like our previous projects to ensure this project will be done on time. Will find simple graphics online to represent the different parts of the robot.

### Technologies Used
For this app, we will be using the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Spring Boot
- Javascript
- Java
